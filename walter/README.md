# Walter Language Support

This folder provides a Walter language definition for Visual Studio Code. Language definitions are required to associate code snippets with a particular language/file format, and to provide appropriate syntax highlighting.

## Installation
Clone/download this folder's contents to the following path:
- Windows _%USERPROFILE%\.vscode\extensions_
- MacOS _~/.vscode/extensions_
- Linux _~/.vscode/extensions_

Code should now automatically detect _rtconfig.txt_ files as Walter (for standard installations, languages are displayed in the bottom-right corner on the status bar).
