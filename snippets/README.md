# ReaScript code snippets

This folder provides auto-complete snippets for ReaScripts in a variety of languages.

## Installation
Download a _.code-snippets_ file and place it in Code's _snippets_ folder:
- Windows _%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\snippets_
- MacOS _Not sure_
- Linux _Not sure_

Code should automatically detect it (might require a restart) and start offering suggestions when you type in a file using the appropriate language.
